                <p class="sub text-small">We provide travel and tourism-related services to the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers. We can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. We can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. Our main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of asupplier. We do not keep inventory in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.</p>

                <p class="sub text-small">We often receive commissions and other benefits and incentives from providers or may charge a fee to the end users. Hotel owners and tour operators typically pay a higher commission rate to travel agencies, whereas
                airlines typically pay a low commission. The customer is normally not made aware of how much the travel agent is earning in commissions and other benefits.</p>

                <p class="sub text-small">We use the services of the major computer reservations systems, also known as global distribution systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo GDS, Sabre, and Worldspan, which is a subsidiary of Travelport, which allow for comparison and sorting of hotel and flight rates with multiple companies.Bookings made via us may or may not be confirmed instantly. Unlike online travel agencies, metasearch engines and scraper sites, such as Skyscanner, Kayak.com, Rome2rio, and TripAdvisor, may or may not have their own booking engine,
                and instead provide results for search queries and then divert traffic to service providers or online travel agencies for booking. We also work with airline consolidators.</p>

                Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) in the United Kingdom, and the Airline Reporting Corporation in the United States also serve those purposes. ABTA â€“ The Travel Association and the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), represent
